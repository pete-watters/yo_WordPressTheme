# kontainers_WP_theme
This repository contains the Kontainers custom Wordpress theme. We are making use of the modern technology avaiable by using a Yeoman generated theme called 'Generator WP theme': https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-wp-theme

Using this generator will offer us a lot of workflow improvements right out of the box such as SASS integration, JS minification, JS linting and many other features. You can read more about this here:
