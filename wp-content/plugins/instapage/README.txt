== Description ==

WordPress is the giant in the CMS world; the same is true for Instapage in the
landing page domain- now imagine the power you'll unleash when you combine
both these platforms together. With Instapage you get far more customization
options with your WordPress landing pages than a standalone plugin.

This is what we're offering you. We allow you to publish the conversion ready
landing pages you've built within Instapage to appear as a natural extension
of your WordPress blog or website. All you have to do is select the 'Push to
WordPress' publishing option within Instapage when you're finished with your
landing page.

== Installation ==

Step 1: Install the plugin.
Step 2: Create a completely customizable landing page for FREE here: http://www.instapage.com
Step 3: Sync your masterpiece to wordpress with one click.
